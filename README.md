An application of Deep Learning requires passing the image to the model for 
processing and generating its description, to finally develop an image caption 
generator. Multiple modelling techniques i.e., CNN-LSTM, GRU, RNN can be 
used to achieve it.
The major goal of an image caption generator is to create an artificial intelligence 
model that can generate a textual description of an image. The model will then be
able to recognize the objects, people, or other elements in the image and use 
natural language to describe them in a way that makes sense. The ultimate aim is 
to provide a useful tool for image recognition, search, and indexing, as well as 
applications in fields such as healthcare, security, and entertainment.
This is a problem that integrates computer vision and natural language 
processing, so its main challenges arise from the need of translating between two 
distinct, but usually paired modalities. It includes the labeling of an image with 
English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training.

In conclusion, image captioning using deep learning techniques has been a rapidly 
advancing field in recent years. With the development of deep neural networks and the 
availability of large annotated image datasets, researchers have made significant 
progress in generating accurate and meaningful captions for images.
Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly 
used to extract features from images, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as 
long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit Model (GRU) networks are 
used to generate captions based on these features.
We also carried out BLEU Score to evaluate the model performance, where the value 
of most of the score are above and equal to 0.3 (~30%) which indicates that the captions 
generated were quite accurate and understandable.
We also carried out the live demo(), which serve as a useful tool for demonstrating the 
potential of image captioning systems. Based on the performance of the models, we 
carried out the live demo using the GRU Model. Ultimately, the goal of an image 
caption generator is to enhance the usability and accessibility of visual content on the 
internet and beyond.
